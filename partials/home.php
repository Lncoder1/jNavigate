<h2>Ajaxify your web app with jNavigate</h2>

<p>
  jNavigate is a powerful jQuery plugin that enables ajax content loading 
  via a configurable yet simple set of options. Turn content links
  and forms into triggers that fetch html from the server and update your
  webpage without the need for reloads.
</p>

<p>
  This small demo site is powered by jNavigate with the side navigation set as 
  external triggers and content links set as internal triggers. Form posts
  are also supported by jNavigate as can be seen on the <a class="trigger"
  href="index.php?page=form">example form</a> page. jNavigate also utilises
  history in modern browsers that support the changes to the history API
  added in the HTML5 specifications.
</p>

<p>
  Not eveyone has javascript enabled in their browser and we
  should all be figuring this when building applications. jNavigate
  passes through the <code>jnavigate</code> flag with every request so you
  can pick and choose what to return in the response, server side, giving the 
  same experience to all of your users. Turn javascript off and take a look 
  around this demo and you will notice all links maintain their proper 
  functionality. More information about jNavigate can be found on the 
  <a class="trigger" href="index.php?page=docs">Documentation</a> page.
